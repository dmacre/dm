        <p class="lead blog-description">This blog and the tabbed websites are a compilation of weeks 1-9 of the VERY intense coding bootcamp I attended to become a Web Developer. The course was 9 weeks long but we were building our first websites by the second day. Please read on to see the journey.</p>

        	<p><h3>The Recipe Project</h3>The first project was to build a basic html5 recipe page using an example the instructor sent us through our Slack Channel. Slack was new to us as well as Github which is where we had to push our projects to. By the end of the first week we had created 3 pages on this project. The recipe page, a page for site visitors to enter their recipes, a contact us page. All the pages had to have navigation links to jump from page to page, same header across all pages, we used a mouse over hover function on the table in the recipe table which highlights the ingredients. By the end of week one we had used html5, CSS3,  Flexbox models, image links, drop down menus, and much more. You can see the finished project by clicking the recipe tab above.</p>

            <h3>Bootstrap Project</h3>
            <p>In this project on week 2 we were given a screenshot showing a webpage template we had to recreate using bootstrap. Although it was a very basic project getting the circles and text to align on the page was key in understanding the columnar grid layout in Bootstrap. (special thanks to the Twitter devs that made Bootstrap an open source project so we can all use it!!) Plesae click the "Bootstrap" tab to see the finished project.

            <h3>Week Three</h3>
              <p>Week three consisited of learning basic Javascript and jquery functions. We were given "challenges" that we needed to complete to make the result post in console log. These were basic skills that would be expounded upon in future assignments but we were at a point in the course to learn somehat about these functions in order to perform on the upcoming projects. We learned about calling arrays, counting up by an increase of 1 up to a max of 10, etc. 

              We also attended a networking event through Tampa Bay Technology Forum (TBTF) "Tech Tuesday". It's a monthly meet up for networking where many of the local web design firms head honchos were in attendance. I made some great contacts and in fact due to my follow up with some of the sales guys from Kforce our bootcamp is getting help from their HR department and career placement division with our resume's and job placement.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
            <p>On week three we also downloaded photoshop and were given a sample page in which we had to "lift" image objects from the sample and recreate the page. We had to also track the CSS and use some oher basic functionality of Photoshop. My free Photoshop trial is about to expire so "Sketchpad" here I come. You can see this project in the Photoshop tab.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Resume</h3>
            <p>Week four we were given a sample resume page to try to copy. We were given some freedom to do some of our own design. We had to use a carousel, and some jquery plug-ins to make our page come alive. I wanted to have some fun with this project so I used the carousel to rotate my photo with an alternate photo - hope you like it - and we had use many of the skills learned to this point to make our sites more interactive and exciting. Check out the Resume tab. There is a pdf of my resume available in the website. See if you can find it!</p>

            <h3>Flip and Match Card Game</h3>
            <p>Week five...really challenging. The assignment...create a Star Wars Card Match Game. The object of the game is to flip cards over and make matches. The learning for this project was to increase our Javascript skills, call an API, parse the data and make the card game work. We were also partnered with another student and had to work in teams using Github branches so we could see what merge conflicts were and how to resolve them. Check out the "Game" tab and see if you can make the matches in record time.</p>
            <h3>SASS, GRUNT, LESS</h3>
            <p>If you don't know coding you might think these are something different terms for coding. Week six we learned about all three. It was a short week as we all attended the Front End Design Conference, St. Pete Fl on May 21st and 22nd. Not only were some major sponsors there like IBM, Creative Circle, and Shopify, but some of the best developers and artists in the world gave presentations. It was well worth a few days out of the classroom to learn and network with our peers.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Angular js</h3>
            <p>Week seven was all about MVC, angular js
